# Playing around with tools 
During class today, we went through how to use tools to give a 3D object its texture. Using the website 'Solar System Scope', we downloaded textures that could be added onto the sphere.

In Unity, I right clicked on the Sample Scene and add a '3D object' and clicked on the shape 'sphere'. Then by making a new folder in assets, I named it 'textures' and uploaded the materials I downloaded.

These are the materials that I downloaded from the website. Then I dragged these materials onto the sphere...

These were the results. 

# Brainstorming ideas
Change of environment:
- swimming pool to the dining room 
- beach to a village/mountain ranges 
- village to snow mountain

Sketch 1: Sketch of village to snow mountain. (Left to right)

Sketch 2: Sketch of swimming pool to dining room. (Up to down)

Sketch 3: Sketch of beach to village/mountain ranges. (Left to right)



From the sketches I did, I the idea of moving from a village to the snow mountains. I feel like these two environments will transform nicer and easier since their mapping shape is similar and environment are similar too(many trees). I also quite like it when moving from beach to a village, that it gives a happy vibe to a chill vibe. 

List of assets I'll be using if I were to do Sketch 1: 
- falling snow (myself)
- Mountains and hills (myself)
- Ponds/hot spring (myself)
- Houses and trees/grass (Unity Asset Store)
-Textures of the field and snow (Unity Asset Store)
- Audio of wind and fire (online)

List of assets I'll be using if I were to do Sketch 2: 
- swimming pool(myself)
- pool stool (Unity Asset Store)
- Table/plates and chairs (Unity Asset Store)
-Kitchen supplies (Unity Asset Store)
- Textures of table and floor (Unity Asset Store)
- Audio of water (myself)
- Audiio of fire (online)

List of assets I'll be using if I were to do Sketch 3: 
- beach water (myself)
- sand (myself)
- beach chairs and houses (Unity Asset Store)
- trees and flowers (Unity Asset Store)
- Textures of sand and grass (Unity Asset Store)
- Audio of Water (myself)
- Audio of rustling trees (online)

Sketch 1: Since the environment are similar from a village to the snow mountain, the colour of the ground could slowly gradually change (green slowly to white) Furtheremore, the addition of snow in the opposite environment could significant a change too. 

Sketch 2: There could be a door that could open from one slide to another. As an example, the exit door of the swimming centre to a transparent door to a dining room. 

Sketch 3: Alike Sketch 1, the texture and colour change of the floor could transform one place to another. For example, yellow sound slowly turning into green grass. Or maybe could pass a bridge to get into the other environment.
