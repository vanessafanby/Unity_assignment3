These are the audio sources found from 'pixabay' that I've decided to use for my project. 

This is my audio setting for 'water'. I turned on the 'Loop', adjusted the maximum distance and changed the soatial blend from 2D to 3D.

This is where I placed my audio on the map.

# Adding 1st Person Perspective

First of all, I right clicked and created a new '3D object' --> capsule, then dragged the main camera file into the 3D object file, and reset the camera all to 0.

Then, I created a 'Player Movement Script' in 'Assets' to allow the player move in first person.
