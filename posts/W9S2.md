# Finalising
I decided to add 'water' audio to hot springs and add audio of 'birds chirping' near the houses. And adding on small object the way I go through my game. This is a set of audio I used for my Assignment 3 project.

This is a set of Package Assets downloaded from Unity Asset Store.

I added some flowers nears the pond. This adds colour, texture and visual appear to the pond area, enhancing the beauty of the nature in the environment,

I added some street lamp on the village pathways, LEADING to the entrance door to the other environment,

This is the best bridge that I could find. (to solve the issue of the character falling down into the water)

I placed my 'birds chirping' audio near the houses, giving the audience a feeling of ambient nature.

I changed the maximum distance in 3D sound settings to 120, the others stayed the same.

I placed my 'water' audio for hotsprings above the water.
