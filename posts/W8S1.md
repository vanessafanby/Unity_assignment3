# Final Environment

Below is a new sketch that I'm going to stick with. I made the map clearer (less paths), and more easier to play around. The yellow star is the first person object going around.

From the previous map that I did, the hills were a little werid. It seems out that the brushes that I used didn't suit, therefore I changed the brush to a bigger and more blurrier one.

I started off creating a new terrain, aiming to make the overall shape natural as possible by slowly raising and lowering the terrian.

Then I added the same grass and snow texture that I used previously from the package, creating the ground texture for the village and snow mountain.

Using the same technique previously, I added on the path using the painting brush and the trees using the treebrush. The look gave me a chiller and more relaxed compared to the previous one.

I repeated the same step to the snow mountain side. I lowered the terrain by using 'shift' to shape the pond that I'll be doing later. I decided to add bushes on the dividing line to make the environment not look awkward. If there were no bushes, the viewer may think that it was too of a sudden in a change of place. Moreover, I will need to add snow on the snow side, the adding of bushes is more reasonable.

Below is a list of textures that I used for this map.

# Adding ons
I wanted to get a snowing effect on the snow mountain side to let the audience to feel a sense of calm and relief, allowing them to feel that they're actually placed in 'that' environment.

These were the steps:
![description](/W8S1/snowinspector.png)
1. Change of 'Start Lifetime'
2. Chnage of 'Start Speed'
3. Change of 'Start Size'
4. Change of '3D Start Rotation'
5. Change of 'Gravity Source'

6. Change of 'Emission'
7. Change of 'Shape'

8. Change of 'Velocity over Lifetime'

9. Change of 'Collision'

This is an overall image with the 'snowing' particles. 


I found the default background a little boring, and wanted to change it to a night view. This not only will make the environment look more appealing, the snowing effect also stands out more in the dark.

By clicking on 'Window', 'Rendering', then 'Lighting', I was able to turn the default background environment to a night view. 

This was the effect after adding different lighting. The snow tends to bond together better, and the overall environment seems to be more natural.

This asset was the one that I used (Found in Unity Asset Store)

# Creating Water
I found it quite challenging to add water to the pond. The first step is to right click to add a new 3D object, a 'plane', then draging it to the object you want it to be filled with water.

I also had to add a new 'water material' in my assets in order to add the water. 
![description](/W8S1/watermaterial.png)

Then, clicking 't' to adjust the shape, and change the colour setting on the right. 
![description](/W8S1/ponding.png)

Here, I adjusted the colour to look more natural in 'emission', 'colour'. To add on, I changed the material to be 'transparent' too. This is what the pond looks after I added the water layer.

I repeated the same step to the hotsprings....
![description](/W8S1/hotspring.png)


also to the fountain!!

![description](/W8S1/fountain.png)

I added more items into both scenes. In the snow mountain scene, I added rocks as the entrance path, leading up to a a fountain. At the back, I added a house sort of shape, making it look like a hotel. 
![description](/W8S1/stone.png)

In the village scene, I added a small house and a firestool after crossing the bridge. This is a place where the characters in that setting could cook marshmallows? and having a chill time.

![description](/W8S1/wall.png)
I also decided to included a wall and a entrance to divded the two places. This not only makes the audience feel 'welcomed' but also amazed by the new scene. I added additional fire on wall as a symbolism of 'warmth' and 'welcome'. 

Since I'm thinking of setting one of my environments in a village, I found packages of houses in the Asset Store and added them on.

This is what it looks like from the village side.
