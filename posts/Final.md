# Reflection

Overall, I really enjoyed this project. Although most of the time I found it challenging, but I also found it really fun coping with challenges that I faced. 

I'm really pleased with the work that I've done, and really happy with the final look. As an the example, the change of environment, and the snowing effect. If there was something to improve on, I would say changing the sound effects. It was quite confusing with the fire audio and wind hustling audio. Since they were so similar, it was pretty hard to distinguish. 

If there was another chance, I would definitely create another game using UnityÔºÅ
