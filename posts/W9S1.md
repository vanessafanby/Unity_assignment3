In the Google Survery, most people commented 'YES' for smoothly transitioning and suitable audio. Google Charts reflected on what was good and what needed change. The pie chart commented on what was unclear. 

Some also said that the bridge was really narrow. Therefore I'm going to look for some wider ones, or look for one with handrails.

I'm thinking of changing the sound of the audio louder and maybe adding new audios too.
