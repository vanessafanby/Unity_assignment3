# Playing around with terrain 
![description](/static/W7S2/Terrain.png)
I right clicked and selected '3D Objects' and 'Terrain'. It gave me a large land to play around with. I noticed that the different coloured arrows had different funtions. 
Green: Up and down 
Blue: Right and left 
Red: Front and back

By pressing on the mountain brush icon, I could change the bumpiness of the ground. Since I want to do mountains for my project, I raised the terrain to get a 'hill' effect. Different brushes had different effects too. By using bigger and blurry blushes, the 'hills' looked more natural, whereas the blunt brushes had a more solid and sharp effect.

I also changed the brush size and opacity to a greater number. I found out that big brush size with a medium opacity number turned out to be nice. 

# My final idea
I've decided to stick with my first sketch, which is transitioning from a village to the snow mountains. By using the terrain tools, I feel like this setting is more easier to pursue. 

Below is a final sketch that I decided to stick with. Starting from the left side of the path, tracing 3 paths to get to the right.

I started off making different shapes of the terrian using the brush tool, then deciding which version I liked the most. It turned out that I like the 3rd version the best, however the mountains turned out too spicky.

It turned out that the brush I used was wrong. By clicking on the 'shift' keyboard, I was able to adjust the height of the hilltop. 

This is the wrong brush:

This is the correct brush:

I downloaded multiple assets from Unity Store beforehand. This includes terrian brushes, textures, trees, bushes and flowers.

From the assets that I downloaded, I chose a grass texture that I liked and changed 'raise and lowering terrain' to 'paint texture' to adjust the ground texture and colour.

This is the 'moss' texture that I used from the Package.

I coloured half of the map green first to see the results...

Then I added dirt texture using the same tool to get a path. By using the treebrush tool, I was able to quickly apply the trees on the map. I was able to choose the size of the brush with the opacity. I realised that the bigger brush size, smaller opacity made the trees more spread apart. Whereas the smaller brush size, bigger opacity made the trees more packed together. 


There were a lot of 3D grass objects found in the package.

The grassbrush has the same effect too. Therefore I added grass onto the hills and this were the results..

To make the map and track more better lookindg, I decided to add some rock textures beside the dirt texture to make it more natural.

I applied the same technique to the snow side. I used the same painting tool to change the texture to snow. Also applied trees and bushes using the tree and grassbrush tool.

This is a list of trees that I used from the asset package.

Below is a list of textures that I used for this map.

This is the overall effect in bird eye view. I feel like I added too much paths on the left side. This not only will make the map more completed, it'll also make the person playing it more confused. I'm thinking of maybe starting a new sketch.
